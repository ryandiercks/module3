2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A database would be used when data needs/has the possibility to be stored, retrieved, and updated. A text file is
used to store standard structured data that is readable for humans. You can't format it. It's used for basic information
you need to get across and can be understood without formatting.


3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
It’s very good at getting results from data, updating data, or making new structures to store data. It 
does a great job at defining queries. But it’s not a general purpose language that 
you can use to make games like Fortnite, iPhone apps, etc. 


4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
A database allows for the storage of data that might need to be quickly read, written, and changed. 
To do this database systems use tables and a binary file format that will normally hard to read by 
humans is easy with the use of a interface.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
Table - is used to store data in a way that is easy to see what each value means and be easily changed.
Row - used to group values into a complete unit.
Column - used to describe what information is stored there. 
Value - meaning a cell in the table with a piece of information.
