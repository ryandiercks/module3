1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

When we are looking for a contact from a phonebook, the names are listed in alphabetical order. Searching from the name and then keep going down until finding the correct one. 

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A real-life scenario would be searching for your book in a library. If you have
books organized in alphabetical order by shelves, and you don't know which shelf contains
your book, check the middle shelf. If not found, eliminate half of the shelves based on alphabetical
order of your book and search the middle of the halved shelves. Continue the process until
the book is found.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

	7 iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

	3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Linear would be the better algorithm due to binary cutting the collection in half based on a random item. Due to binary being useless unless the data is in order from smallest to biggest.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary would be best due to linear search possibly having to go the end of the collection. Since the collection is sorted, binary search must be used for a collection this large. Binary 
search can effectively half of the collection after one iteration, if necessary. It can continue halving the collection as the middle changes and checked against input value.

Programming Assignment
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

  function binarySearch (list, target) {
    let start  = 0;
    let end    = list.length-1;
    let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
    
    while (list[mid] !== target && start < end) {
      if (target < list[mid]) {
        end = mid - 1;
      } else {
        start = mid + 1;
      }    
      mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
    }
    
    return ((list[mid] !== target) ? -1 : (mid + 1 ));
  }

  console.log(binarySearch([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 10));

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

  let fish = ['blue','grey','black','white','blue','orange','grey'];
  
  function linearSearch(array, target){
    for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
      if(array[i] === target){
        return `${target} fish is in tank ` + (i+1);
      }
    }
  }
  
  console.log(linearSearch(fish, 'white'));
