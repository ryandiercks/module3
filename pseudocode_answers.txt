Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	Programmers use pseudocode to develop algorithms. Pseudocode helps to produce an idea of solving a problem.
If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
	Computer doesn’t understand and run pseudocode. Pseudocode for human reading only.

Programming Assignment

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

printGreaterNumber (number1, number 2)
{	
//IF number 1 is greater than number2 THEN
	// RETURN number1	
//ELSE 
	// RETURN number 2
//END IF
}

JavaScript Implementation

printGreaterNumber (number1, number 2) {
	if (number1 > number2) {
		return number1} else {
		return number2}
				}

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

printNumber() {
	//INIT number to 1
	//FOR number is smaller than 101, INCREMENT number
		//PRINT number
	//ENDFOR
}

JavaScript Implementation

	printNumber() {
		let numb = 1;
		for (numb, numb < 101; numb++) {
	console.log(numb) 	}
	
3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

Function searchEntry (entry)
{
	//IF entry is in the phonebook THEN
		//RETURN entry
//ELSE
		//RETURN entry is not listed in phonebook
//END IF 	}

JavaScript Implementation

	searchEntry(entry) {
		if (phonebook.includes(entry)){
			return entry}
		else {
			return entry + ‘is not listed in phonebook’}
		}
